Nirikshak is a framework, which provides the facility to do repetitive task
with different sets of inputs. For example, you need to continously call some
REST APIs, perform cleanup tasks, monitor CPU loads, disk usage etc. There
can be hundresds or thousands of such tasks in large set of cluster, to do
or create such scripts can be painful for each projects. Scripts are difficult
or rarely made to reuse for different project. Here comes the Nirikshak to
save you, Nirikshak provides facility to create module's which can be reused
again and again. After some times these modules will become stable and most of
the functionality could be achieved through them therefor there will be
possibiltiy of less bugs gets introduced and reuse of the aleardy tested
modules.

Nirikshak is a highly pluggable and configurable framework, which can be
configured to behave as maintenance tool, system verifier, testing framework,
health checker or a monitoring tools. These are some of the examples, you
can do a lot more, you can convert this framework into the tools. You must be
intelligent enough to configure it as per your requirement.

Nirikshak provides a lot of flexibility you can not even imagine at this point
of time :). Nirikshak provides the abstract interfaces, you can plug your
module's by implementing those interfaces. Currently a very few modules are
implemented, as need arises or request is received from the community other
modules can be added.
